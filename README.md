Files for home automation repo

Roadmap:
(1) Sensors to detect and view data.
(2) Connect to Raspberry Pi using Hass.io
(3) Read data via Hass.io
(4) Store data in any format
(5) Store data in database

Separate work from here:
Ryan focus:
- database -> server -> application

Miggy focus:
- more sensors -> raspberry pi -> database

Consolidate again
Ryan & Miggy focus on logic for data to trigger devices (ie certain temperature reading to turn on aircon)

Roadmap:
* Sensors to detect and view data.
* Connect to Raspberry Pi using Hass.io
* Read data via Hass.io
* Store data in any format
* Store data in database

Separate work from here:
Ryan focus:
- database -> server -> application

Miggy focus:
- more sensors -> raspberry pi -> database

Consolidate again
Ryan & Miggy focus on logic for data to trigger devices (ie certain temperature reading to turn on aircon)
